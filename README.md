This repository organizes all experimental validation results for Common-Mode Chokes (CMCs) according to the magnetic core on which each sample is wound. Each top-level folder is named after a specific core type—for example, the directory W452 contains all validation data associated with CMC samples wound on the W452 core. This structure allows users to easily navigate results across different core families and compare behaviors under varying magnetic materials and geometries.

Within each core-specific directory, two subfolders are provided to separate numerical results from visual outputs. The csv folder stores the computed impedance estimation results produced at different modeling stages, along with summary tables comparing prediction performance across these stages. The figure folder contains all corresponding impedance plots, including measured-versus-predicted curves, residual comparisons, and stage-by-stage visual evaluations. This separation ensures that both raw numerical data and visualization materials are clearly organized and easy to reference.

In addition to these folders, each directory includes two supplementary files that describe the physical characteristics of the CMCs. The file physical_parameters.txt records the geometric, material, and construction parameters of the corresponding CMC samples, while mu.csv contains the magnetic permeability data used in the modeling and analytical derivations. Together, these files provide the necessary physical context required for interpreting the impedance results, reproducing simulations, and extending the modeling workflow.
